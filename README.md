- [8051 Microcontroller](link-to-8051-microcontroller)
- [Proteus Simulation Software](link-to-proteus)

## Getting Started

1. The user using it must have keil as a programming software to edit the programming teriminiologies as per choice.
2. The user must have proteus to perfrom simulation for the project and testing it.
3. If implemented on original circuit must have 8051 microcontroller and a flashing board in order to flash the program into the micriocontroller.
4. Lastly you can test the circuit accordingally.
